# Employee Directory

This is the 8th project that I completed for the Treehouse Front End Techdegree. This project uses Flexbox and Fetch API to create a fictional employee directory with a modal popup, created with vanilla JavaScript, that includes more information about each employee.

You can view a demo [here](https://alyssavoccia.github.io/employee-directory/).
